#If you cross a 490meterlong street in 7 minutes, calculate your speed in meters per second. Print the answer without any decimal point in it. Hint: Speed = Distance / Time

streetLength = 490
time = 7

# Definfing it's formula

speed = (streetLength)/7

#Converting Minutes into Seconds

result=(speed)/60

#Converting the float value into Integer Value

fspeed=int(result)

#printing the result

print("Speed : ",fspeed,"m/s" " " "approx")
